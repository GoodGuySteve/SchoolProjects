This project is for an AI course to construct a learning agent to analyze the sentiment (positive/negative) of various documents.
It uses a training set with pre-set outcomes to train the model for use on test data. 

One of the parameters of the assignment was to utilize a decision tree structure. 
Subgoals of the project were to get reasonable accuracy in a short time.
This program was able to achieve 74% accuracy in 30 seconds (including both training and testing).

---------------------------------
To run this project, simply run the .sln file to execute the code.
If running from the command line, two input files must be given: the training set and the testing set.
Ex)
  ./CS165_MP2.exe < train.txt sample_testing.txt

---------------------------------
There is a pdf report that explains the assignment and outcomes in more detail.

The project was written in C++ and assembled in Microsoft Visual Studio.
