This project is a parallel Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm written using C++ and Cilk. 
It was compiled using the Intel C++ compiler and run on the Triton parallel computing cluster.
All the test files are RMAT, a format for randomly generating very specific types of unordered graphs similar to social media graphs.

This exercise was primarily geared towards taking a well-known serial algorithm (BFS) and parallelizing it as best as possible.

The program was created to run on a very specific architecture, and so is not able to be tested.
However, the source code is available for your viewing convenience.

Much more specific information about the goal, code structure, and outcomes are available in the PDF report
