This is my personal repository for all of my classwork. Careful where you step - it's a bit of a mess.

If you're here to check out some samples of my code, check out the SHOWCASE directory. 
It has some of my better work that has been cleaned up a little bit. 

Note that I do have larger projects I have worked on professionally, but those projects are not public and I cannot share samples of those.
