% Write out whether or not the following queries are true or
% false, replacing `???` where appropriate.
% If a query is true and involves variable instantiations, then write out
% all possible variable instantiations which make the query
% true.  Some have already been done for you, to give an
% example of the expected format, and to provide additional examples.
% If you wish, you may simply
% copy and paste the output of SWI-PL here directly; we will be grading
% this by hand, so the output format isn't important.

% ANSWER: (X = 1, Y = 2)

% QUERY: 1 - 2 = -(X, Y).
