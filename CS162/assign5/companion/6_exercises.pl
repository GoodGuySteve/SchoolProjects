% Write code below which will convert a temperature in Fahrenheit to
% Celsius.  Note that you cannot simply use the definition of
% `c_to_f` directly from the tutorial, since Prolog in and of itself
% cannot reason about arithmetic in reverse.  Your clause should be
% named `f_to_c`, and it should take two parameters: the Fahrenheit
% and Celsius temperatures, respectively.

% Recall that the formula conversion is the following:
%
% C = (F - 32) * (5 / 9)
%
% ...where `F` and `C` represent the temperatures in Fahrenheit
% and Celsius, respectively

% ---REPLACE ME WITH CODE---

% With your conversion routine in hand, the following queries should
% all succeed:

% QUERY 1: f_to_c(0, -17.77777777777778).
% QUERY 2: f_to_c(32, 0.0).
% QUERY 3: f_to_c(212, 100.0).
