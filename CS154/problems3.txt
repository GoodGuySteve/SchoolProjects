CS 154 - Cache Problems

1Using the the series of addresses below, show the hits and misses 
and final cache contents for a cache with the following configuration:
Word size: 4 bytes
Block size: 8 words
Associativity: 4-way
Total cache size: 512 bytes
Replacement Policy: LRU

Answer the following questions:
How many bits are used for the byte offset?
1a) 2 bits
How many bits are used for the block offset?
1b) 3 bits
How many blocks fit in the cache?
1c) 16 blocks
How many sets are in the cache?
1d) 4 sets
How many bits are in the index?
1e) 2 bits
How many bits are in the tag?
1f) 25 bits

Given the following sequence of load addresses, report which ones are 
misses.  For example, if the first and second are misses, the third is a 
hit, and the rest are misses, the answer would be:

2.AMAT - Average Memory Access Time

To capture the fact that the time to access data for both hits and 
misses affects performance, designers often use average memory access 
time (AMAT) as a way to examine alternative cache designs. 
Average memory access time is the average time to access memory 
considering both hits and misses and the frequency 
of different access.  The unit is either expressed in cycles / access or 
time / access, depending on what the problem gives you.
The most basic equation is: AMAT = AccessTime + missrate*misspenalty.

You want to look at the performance of two caches configurations by comparing 
the AMATs of each one. The first is a single, large cache.
This 2M cache, direct-mapped cache has an access time of 6 cycles and 
hit rate of 99%.  Accessing DRAM requires 100 cycles.
What is the AMAT of cache 1?
2a) 7 cycles

Now let's compare that to a 4-way set associative cache that has an 
access time of 10 cycles and a hit rate of 99.5%.  
What is the AMAT of cache 2?
2b) 10.5 cycles


Now we want to explore what happens if we create two caches - a small and
fast one as a level 1 cache and a larger, slower one for the level 2 cache.
The level 1 cache is a 256K cache with an access time of 2 cycle and 
hit rate of 95% The second cache is a 1M cache with an 10 cycle access time 
and a 65% hit rate.  Hint:  The miss penalty of the first cache is the 
AMAT of the second cache.  The total AMAT of the system is the AMAT of the 
level 1 cache (assuming the second cache is taken into account for its
miss penalty). 
What is the AMAT of this multi-level cache?
2c) 4.25 cycles

Question that will not be graded by the submit system - just a study 
question for the exam:

3. Cache C1 is direct-mapped with 16 one-word blocks.  Cache C2 is 
direct-mapped with 4 four-word blocks. Assume that the miss penalty for C1 
is 8 clock cycles and the miss penalty for C2 is 11 clock cycles.
Assuming that the caches are initially empty, find a reference string for 
which C2 has a lower miss rate but spends more cycles on 
cache misses than C1.
Use word addresses.

word 0, word 4, word 8, word 1
(4 misses for C1: 32 cycles, 3 misses for C2: 33 cycles)
