Lab 0 problems: Data representation and bitwise operations

Remember to solve these individually, working with your partner only when
you get stuck, and seeking help from the TA only when you are both stuck.
You may NOT use any calculators.  Make sure you are on your own computer,
editing your own file.

This is your assignment for the week, not just for the day, so it is 
expected that you will not finish during this lab time.  

For each problem, make sure you write your answer exactly on the line with 
the problem number (i.e. 1a) that follows the question.

1. Convert the following decimal numbers into 8-bit binary with the 
format 0b01001111:
1a) 13 = 0b00001101
1b) 9 = 0b00001001
1c) 19 = 0b00010011

2. Convert the following binary numbers into decimal:
2a) 0101 = 5
2b) 1101 = 13
2c) 1011 = 11

3.  Convert the following decimal numbers into 2-digit hexadecimal numbers.
Report the answers in the format 0xff.  hello
3a) 73 = 0x49
3b) 23 = 0x17
3c) 151 = 0x97

4. Convert the following decimal numbers into 8-bit binary with the
format 0b01001111.  They are stored in 2's complement representation.
4a) -15 = 0b11110001
4b) -6 = 0b11111010
4c) -10 = 0b11110110

5.  Fill in the following properties of binary numbers.  
Remember to place the answer on the line with the problem number.  
Do not capitalize your words.  If you want to express
an exponent, use the '^'.  For example, the value 8 is 2 to the 3rd power.  
Express this as 2^3.

Each sentence has two blanks.  The first needs to be replaced by one of 
the following operations:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus
The second needs to be replaced by an integer (in exponent form).  
Make sure you remove the underscore but retain the period.

5a) Shifting the digits two to the left is the same as performing multiplication by 2^2.
5b) Shifting the digits three to the right is the same as performing division by 2^3.
5c) Performing a bitwise AND with the number 7 is the same as performing modulus by 2^3.

6.  Complete each sentence.
6a) If the bit in bit position 0 is a 1 (for an integer), the number is odd
6b) If a number contains all 0's except a 1 in position n, the value is 2^n

7.  
If I have the number 0xxxxxxxyyyyzzzzz, and I want to extract the three
numbers x, y, and z (the number of times you see them is the number of 
bits for their representation), how do I do so?  In the above example, 
x is 7 bits, y is 4 bits, and z is 5 bits.  x, y, and z are unsigned 
integers.

For each question, answer with the operator:
bitwise and, bitwise or, bitwise not, bitwise xor, shift left, shift right
For the mask or shift values, answer a mask in binary (16 bits in the 
format 0b0100101101001000), and answer a shift value as an integer.
Assume this is an unsigned int storing unsigned ints.

What operator would convert 0bxxxxxxxyyyyzzzzz to 0b00000000000zzzzz?
7a) bitwise and
What would the mask value or number of shift bits be?
7b) 0b0000000000011111
What operator would convert 0bxxxxxxxyyyyzzzzz to 0b0000000yyyy00000?
7c) bitwise and
What would the mask value or number of shift bits be?
7d) 0b0000000111100000
What operator would convert 0bxxxxxxxyyyyzzzzz to 0bxxxxxxx000000000?
7e) bitwise and
What would the mask value or number of shift bits be?
7f) 0b1111111000000000
What operator would convert 0bxxxxxxx000000000 to 0b000000000xxxxxxx?
7g) shift right
What would the mask value or number of shift bits be?
7h) 9

8.  Translate the following instrutions into binary and express as a
hexadecimal.  I have given you one as an example.  Translate these
for the ORIGINAL MIPS machine, not the one for your project.

ex.  add $1, $2, $3
8ex) 0x00430820

a. addi $5, $7, -13
8a) 0x20e5fff3

b.  lw $8, 64($4)
8b) 0x8c880040

c. jr $17
8c) 0x02200008
