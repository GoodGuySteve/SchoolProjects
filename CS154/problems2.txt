This is the answer file for homework 2, performance.  Make sure you 
are looking at the separate question file - not all of the questions
are contained in this file.

1.  Look at problem 1 in the questions document.  Then calculate the 
following statistics.  Determine the effective CPI (Cycles per instruction), 
MIPS (Millions of Instructions per Second) rate, and execution time for 
this program.  Express each answer with as 4 digits.  For CPI and MIPS, 
do not use scientific notation.  For execution time, use scientific notation.
For example, if the CPI was calculated to be 9.8448902853, then you would 
answer:
1ax) CPI = 9.845
And an example of the execution time format is:
1cx) Exec Time = 1.254 x 10 ^ -2

1a) CPI = 2.670
1b) MIPS = 14.98
1c) Exec Time = 6.675 x 10 ^ -3

2.  Now look at the table for execution times (in ms) for systems 
A, B, and C, for the programs v, w, x, y, and z.

First, you are going to normalize all of the execution times to C,
a common calculation to make comparisons more clear.
You are doing the work to fill in the three columns labeled
"Execution Time Normalized to C".  Each box will contain a separate
answer.  Then transfer those answers to the lines below.  For each
answer, include four digits (excluding a leading 0).  You do not need
to move the decimal point and express in 10^x format.  For example,
one answer might be:
2xa) D.x. = 3.000
or another might be:
2xb) D.x. = 0.4582
yet another could be:
2xc) D.x. = 3.489

Execution times normalized to C:
2av) A.v. = 0.7143
2aw) A.w. = 0.5000
2ax) A.x. = 1.467
2ay) A.y. = 0.7843
2az) A.z. = 0.8333
2bv) B.v. = 0.8571
2bw) B.w. = 0.6000
2bx) B.x. = 1.867
2by) B.y. = 1.176
2bz) B.z. = 0.4167
2cv) C.v. = 1.000
2cw) C.w. = 1.000
2cx) C.x. = 1.000
2cy) C.y. = 1.000
2cz) C.z. = 1.000

Now report, for each benchmark, which is the fastest computer system,
A, B, or C?
2fv) v's fastest is A
2fw) w's fastest is A
2fx) x's fastest is C
2fy) y's fastest is A
2fz) z's fastest is B

Now, what are the weighted averages of the three systems?
2wa) A's weighted average is 862.5
2wb) B's weighted average is 520.0
2wc) C's weighted average is 1028

Finally, given the weighted average, which systems is the most desirable,
A, B, or C?
2g) Fastest is B

3. Fill the answers to each question found in the questions file.  Report
3 decimal places.  If an answer is infinity, then answer that.
3a) Speedup is 1.905
3b) The CPU would need to be infinity  times faster than the old CPU.
3c) Highest possible speedup is 2.000

4.  For each function call, report the estimated speedup.
Report 4 digits only.
4a) allocatemem speedup = 1.379
4b) spawnproc = 1.233
4c) authenticate = 1.136
4d) ls = 1.110
