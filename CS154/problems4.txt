These short answer / vocabulary questions are on 
caches, virtual memory, support for parallel
programming, storage, and networks.

Caches:
The following vocabulary words are being used:
direct-mapped
set-associative
fully associative
associativity
block size
cache size
LRU
FIFO
spatial locality
temporal locality

Replace the blank with the proper word.

Many programs follow the principle that if an item has been
used recently, its neighbors will likely be used soon.
c1)  spatial locality

Many programs follow the principle that if an item has been
used recently, it will likely be used again soon.
c2) temporal locality

A cache configuration that has only one set.
c3) fully associative

A cache configuration in which only one tag is checked
each access.
c4) direct-mapped

If you increase this, you increase the miss penalty.
c5) block size

If you increase this, you increase the access time and
the hit time.  There are two answers - report them 
in alphabetical order.
c6) associativity and cache size

Virtual memory:
The vocabulary words for virtual memory are:
operating system
virtual address
physical address
DRAM
TLB
hard drive
process page table
TLB Miss 
Page fault

vm1) DRAM acts as a cache for the hard drive

vm2) TLB acts as a cache for the process page table

vm3) The physical address tells where a piece of data is located in DRAM.

vm4) A TLB Miss is when a translation is not in the TLB.

vm5) A Page fault is when a page is not located in DRAM.

vm6) The operating system manages virtual memory

vm7) The translation translates a virtual address to a physical address.

Question not graded by submit system:
How does virtual memory provide the following services:
a) preventing one process from accessing memory in another's memory
b) preventing an attacker from inserting code into the stack and executing it
c) allowing two processes to share part, but not all, of their memory
d) allowing the total memory allocation to exceed DRAM

Support for parallel programming:

Vocabulary words:
false sharing
atomic
synchronization
lock
barrier

This construct is used to make sure that all processors have 
reached a certain point in the code before moving on.
p1) barrier

This occurs when different processors write to different data
in the same cache line.
p2) false sharing

In order to implement locks or barriers, the architecture must
provide a read/modify instruction that is
p3) atomic

Interconnect networks:
You have four processors configured as a square.

What is the total bandwidth for the network?
n1) 4

What is the bisection bandwidth for the network?
n2) 2

Now add two diagonals.

What is the total bandwidth for the network?
n3) 6

What is the bisection bandwidth for the network?
n4) 4

Question not graded by the submit system:
What is the purpose of the bisection bandwidth?

Storage:
Vocabulary words for this section:
sectors
cylinders
availability
reliability
MTTF
MTTR
RAID

Storage used to be incredibly costly because it was stored on a 
single device that could never fail.  Now, that storage is spread
across several devices, and they are organized to allow for failures
without losing all of the data. What is this system called (acronym)?
s1) RAID

On hard disks, the data is stored in concentric circles.  Multiple read
heads read the same concentric circle on multiple disks at the same time.
What are these called?
s2) cylinders

Each concentric circle is divided into sections.  What are these
sections called?
s3) sectors

The amount of time that a system is up and accepting requests is:
s4) availability

The amount of time between when a system is fixed or start and it 
breaks in such a way that it is unusable is:
s5) MTTF
